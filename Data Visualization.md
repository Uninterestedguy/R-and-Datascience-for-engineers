# Data Mining

## Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of tabulated frequencies, displayed as bars. It illustrates the proportion of cases that fall into each category. Unlike bar charts, which use the height of the bars to represent values, histograms use the area of the bars, making it important when dealing with non-uniform category widths.

## Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is used to visualize bivariate data by representing each pair of values as a set of coordinates and plotting them as points on a plane. It provides an initial exploration of the data, allowing the identification of clusters, outliers, and other patterns.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to provide insights, qualitative overviews, identify patterns, trends, and offer visual proofs.

Categorization of Visualization Methods:

1. Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques:
   - For a dataset with m dimensions, m windows are created on the screen, each representing one dimension.
   - The m-dimensional values of a record are mapped to corresponding pixels in the windows.
   - The colors of the pixels reflect the corresponding values.

2. Geometric Projection Visualization Techniques:
   - Visualization of geometric transformations and projections of data.
   - Methods include direct visualization, scatterplot and scatter plot matrices, landscapes, projection pursuit techniques, prosection views, hyperslice, and parallel coordinates.

3. Icon-Based Visualization Techniques:
   - Visualization of data values as features of icons.
   - Techniques include Chernoff Faces, Stick Figures, shape coding, color icons, and tile bars.

4. Hierarchical Visualization Techniques:
   - Visualization of data using hierarchical partitioning into subspaces.
   - Methods include dimensional stacking, worlds-within-worlds, tree-map, cone trees, and InfoCube.

5. Visualizing Complex Data and Relations:
   - Techniques for visualizing non-numerical data, such as text and social networks.
   - Examples include tag clouds for representing user-generated tags and visualizations of social networks.
